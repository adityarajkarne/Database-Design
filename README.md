# Database-Design

Foodlawn a food court in Indiana University,  caters to thousands of
students every day. Additionally, it has around a hundred employees. The food court currently
doesnâ€™t have a proper database and all its information is stored in a crude manner like in excel
files. The food court needs to keep track of all the employees, their work hours, pay (including
perks like employee meals). Additionally, they need to maintain a record of food orders, items,
billing and as well as the customers. A database that has tables for the functions mentioned
above can be used as a solution. We have created a database so as to manage all the
information that is related to this food court. The users would be the manager and employees
working in the food court.
